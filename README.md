#That's a Rap!
## This program detects and scores raps using natural language processing tools.

##Dependencies

###My setup:
- Python 2.7.6
- NLTK 3.0.2
- pytest 2.7.1

###How to test:
Run `py.test`. That's it!

###How to run:
*You only need to do this once, this is so you can execute with just the file*
`chmod +x test_detect.py`

`./test_detect.py <OPTIONAL textfile1.txt>`
*or*
`python test_detect.py <OPTIONAL textfile1.txt>`

NB: the python has `#!/usr/bin/python` at the top to tell the kernel where the program is to run it (using `./rhyme_detect.py <textfile1.txt>`). This is the *default installation path*, if you chose a different installation directory then you should just use `python rhyme_detect.py <textfile1.txt>`

##Examples
####Perfect Rhyme
*I once met a bully name Kelly,*
*She was always kind of smelly*
