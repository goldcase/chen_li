# Lose Yourself - Eminem

lose_yourself = "His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
        There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
        He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs,
        But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down,
        The whole crowd goes so loud
        He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out"
