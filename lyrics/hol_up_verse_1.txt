I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm a terrorist, eat my asparagus
Then I'm asking her thoughts of a young nigga, fast money and freedom
A crash dummy for dollars, I know you dying to meet 'em
I'll prolly die in a minute, just bury me
With 20 bitches, 20 million, and a Comptown fitted
